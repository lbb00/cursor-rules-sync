# Knowledge Base Maintenance

- When new features are implemented or existing architecture changes, you MUST update `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`.
- Ensure the "Feature Summary" and "Core Concepts" sections reflect the current state of the codebase.
- This file serves as the source of truth for the project's capabilities and design decisions.
