**AI Rules Sync (AIS)**
*Synchronize, manage, and share your agent rules (Cursor rules, Cursor plans, Copilot instructions) with ease.*

AIS allows you to centrally manage rules in Git repositories and synchronize them across projects using symbolic links. Say goodbye to copy-pasting `.mdc` files and drifting configurations.

### Why AIS?

- **🧩 Multi-Repository & Decentralized**: Mix and match rules from various sources—company standards, team-specific protocols, or open-source collections—without conflict.
- **🔄 Sync Once, Update Everywhere**: Define your rules in one place. AIS ensures every project stays in sync with the latest standards automatically.
- **🤝 Seamless Team Alignment**: Enforce shared coding standards and behaviors across your entire team. Onboard new members instantly with a single command.
- **🔒 Privacy First**: Need project-specific overrides or private rules? Use `ai-rules-sync.local.json` to keep sensitive rules out of version control.
- **🛠️ Integrated Git Management**: Manage your rule repositories directly through the CLI. Pull updates, check status, or switch branches without leaving your project context using `ais git`.
- **🔌 Plugin Architecture**: Built with a modular adapter system, making it easy to add support for new AI tools in the future.

## Supported Sync Types

| Tool | Type | Source Directory | Target Directory |
|------|------|------------------|------------------|
| Cursor | Rules | `rules/` | `.cursor/rules/` |
| Cursor | Plans | `plans/` | `.cursor/plans/` |
| Copilot | Instructions | `rules/` | `.github/instructions/` |

## Install

```bash
npm install -g ai-rules-sync
```

## Create a rules repository

- `rules` folder is the default root folder for cursor rules and copilot instructions.
- `plans` folder is the default root folder for cursor plans.
- To use a different folder (e.g., `packages/rules`), add an `ai-rules-sync.json` file to the root of your repository:

  ```json
  {
    "rootPath": "packages/rules"
  }
  ```

## Global Options

All commands support the following global options:

- `-t, --target <repo>`: Specify the target rule repository to use (name or URL).

## Commands

### Config rules git repository

```bash
ais use [git repository url | repo name]
```

If `[git repository url]` is not provided, it will search the repo name in the `~/.cursor-rules-sync/config.json` file.

### List all configured repositories

```bash
ais list
```

### Sync Cursor rules to project

```bash
ais cursor add [rule name] [alias]
# or explicitly:
ais cursor rules add [rule name] [alias]
```

This command must be run in the root of your project.

It will generate a symbolic link from the rules git repository `rules/[rule name]` folder to the project `.cursor/rules/[rule name]` folder.

If you provide an `[alias]`, it will be linked to `.cursor/rules/[alias]`. This is useful for renaming rules or handling conflicts.

**Adding Private Rules:**

Use the `-l` or `--local` flag to add a rule to `ai-rules-sync.local.json` instead of `ai-rules-sync.json`. This is useful for rules that you don't want to commit to git.

```bash
ais cursor add react --local
```

This command will also automatically add `ai-rules-sync.local.json` to your `.gitignore` file.

Examples:

```bash
# Add 'react' rule as 'react'
ais cursor add react

# Add 'react' rule as 'react-v1'
ais cursor add react react-v1

# Add 'react' rule from a specific repo as 'react-v2'
ais cursor add react react-v2 -t other-repo

# Add 'react' rule directly from a Git URL
ais cursor add react -t https://github.com/user/rules-repo.git
```

### Sync Cursor plans to project

```bash
ais cursor plans add [plan name] [alias]
```

This syncs plan files from the rules repository `plans/` directory to `.cursor/plans/` in your project.

```bash
# Add 'feature-plan.md' plan
ais cursor plans add feature-plan

# Add plan with alias
ais cursor plans add feature-plan my-feature

# Remove a plan
ais cursor plans remove my-feature

# Install all plans from config
ais cursor plans install
```

### Sync Copilot instructions to project

```bash
ais copilot add [name] [alias]
```

Default mapping: rules repo `<rootPath>/<name>` → project `.github/instructions/<alias|name>`.

Suffix matching:
- You may pass `foo`, `foo.md`, or `foo.instructions.md`.
- If both `foo.md` and `foo.instructions.md` exist in the rules repo, AIS will error and you must specify the suffix explicitly.
- If `alias` has no suffix, AIS preserves the source suffix (e.g. `ais copilot add foo y` may create `y.instructions.md`).

### Remove entries

```bash
# Remove a Cursor rule
ais cursor remove [alias]

# Remove a Cursor plan
ais cursor plans remove [alias]

# Remove a Copilot instruction
ais copilot remove [alias]
```

This command removes the symbolic link, the ignore entry, and the dependency from `ai-rules-sync.json` (or `ai-rules-sync.local.json`).

### ai-rules-sync.json structure

The `ai-rules-sync.json` file stores Cursor rules, plans, and Copilot instructions separately. It supports both simple string values (repo URL) and object values for aliased entries.

```json
{
  "cursor": {
  "rules": {
    "react": "https://github.com/user/repo.git",
      "react-v2": { "url": "https://github.com/user/another-repo.git", "rule": "react" }
    },
    "plans": {
      "feature-plan": "https://github.com/user/repo.git"
    }
  },
  "copilot": {
    "instructions": {
      "general": "https://github.com/user/repo.git"
    }
  }
}
```

### Local/Private Rules

You can use `ai-rules-sync.local.json` to add private rules/instructions that are not committed to git. This file uses the same structure as `ai-rules-sync.json` and is merged with the main configuration (local takes precedence).

### Install from configuration

If you have an `ai-rules-sync.json` file in your project, you can install all entries with one command:

```bash
# Install all Cursor rules and plans
ais cursor install

# Install all Copilot instructions
ais copilot install

# Install everything (both Cursor and Copilot)
ais install
```

If your project has only one type (Cursor or Copilot) in the config file, you can omit the mode:

```bash
ais install
ais add <name>
ais remove <alias>
```

This will automatically configure repositories and link entries.

### Git Commands

Use git commands to manage the rules git repository.

```bash
ais git [command]
```

Example: check status of a specific repository:

```bash
ais git status -t [repo name]
```

### Legacy compatibility

- If `ai-rules-sync*.json` does not exist but `cursor-rules*.json` exists, AIS will read it temporarily (Cursor rules only).
- Once you run a write command (e.g. `ais cursor add/remove`), it will migrate and write `ai-rules-sync*.json` for easy future removal of legacy code.

### Tab Completion

AIS supports shell tab completion for bash, zsh, and fish.

#### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

On first run, AIS will detect your shell and offer to install tab completion automatically:

```
🔧 Detected first run of ais
   Shell: zsh (~/.zshrc)

Would you like to install shell tab completion?
[Y]es / [n]o / [?] help:
```

You can also install completion manually at any time:

```bash
ais completion install
```

#### Manual Installation

If you prefer to add it manually:

**Bash** (add to `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
eval "$(ais completion)"
```

**Zsh** (add to `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
eval "$(ais completion)"
```

**Fish** (add to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`):

```fish
ais completion fish | source
```

After enabling, you can use Tab to complete rule names:

```bash
ais cursor add <Tab>         # Lists available rules
ais cursor plans add <Tab>   # Lists available plans
ais copilot add <Tab>        # Lists available instructions
```

**Note**: If you encounter `compdef: command not found` errors, ensure your shell has completion initialized. For zsh, add this to your `~/.zshrc` before the ais completion line:

```bash
# Initialize zsh completion system (if not already done)
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

## Architecture

AIS uses a plugin-based adapter architecture:

```
CLI Layer
    ↓
Sync Engine (linkEntry, unlinkEntry)
    ↓
Adapters (cursor-rules, cursor-plans, copilot-instructions)
    ↓
Config Layer (ai-rules-sync.json)
```

This modular design makes it easy to add support for new AI tools (MCP, Windsurf, etc.) in the future.
